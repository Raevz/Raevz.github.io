# About Me
I'm a fourth year Electrical Engineering student at BCIT focused on practical embedded systems, robotics, and software systems.

I like working on projects that allow me to take a solution from start to finish. 

I am currently working on a capstone project with other members of my team from BCIT. We are working to program a Nao robot (from Aldebaran Robotics) to perform to the specifications of the [UBC NEST Lab.](https://www.nestlab.ca/) This includes programming the robot to perform dances, stretches, and conversations. Programming is mainly in the proprietary software Choregraphe (Python based). If you're interested in the project please see the video linked in the projects section below and feel free to message me.

# What I’m focused on right now
- Embedded firmware + RTOS patterns (task design, concurrency, logging, serial tooling)
- Sensors and signal processing (radar-ish sensing, serial protocols, real-world noise)
- Building “demoable” systems: repeatable builds, clear docs, clean interfaces
- Developing reliable robotic systems

---

# Skills (practical)
**Embedded / Firmware**
- C/C++, FreeRTOS-style tasking, interrupts, concurrency, debugging, serial tooling
- Peripheral interfaces: UART, SPI, I2C, GPIO, PWM

**Software / Tools**
- Python for automation and utilities (serial parsing, CSV logs, quick tooling)
- MATLAB for modeling/simulation when it saves time
- Git/GitHub workflows, documentation, reproducible builds

**FPGA / Digital Design**
- SystemVerilog basics, hardware/software partitioning, memory-mapped I/O
- SoC integration concepts (FPGA ↔ processor communication)

**Hardware**
- Prototyping, soldering, bring-up/debug with scope/logic analyzer
- Working with real constraints (power, grounding, signal integrity)
